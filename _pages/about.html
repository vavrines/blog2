<body>
    <p>My name is Tianbai. I know very little about anything, while I’m working on physics, programming and fine arts.
    I create pieces which solve the problems there. Often the problems are themselves caused by other pieces, which were also written by me.
    I feel like I'm a pure oriental from bones.</p>

    <p>I'm currently a research associate at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.
    In may daily work, I play with applied mathematics, with a special focus on fluid mechanics.
    I teach courses and supervise students on kinetic theory and high-performance computing.
    Before I came to Karlsruhe, I was a Ph.D. student at Peking University and a research assistant at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
    You can find a full list of my research outcome <a href='https://xiaotianbai.com/portfolio/research.html'>here</a>.
    I'm also reachable on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFTQeXwAAAAJ&hl=en'>Google Scholar</a> and <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianbai_Xiao'>ResearchGate</a>.</p>
